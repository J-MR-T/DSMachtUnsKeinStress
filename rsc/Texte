// When player loses the first life

Dear contestant,

in order to keep motivation high for the following ordeals, we have decided to slightly adjust the rules for your survival: 

To secure your life you only need to protect 40% of all attainable points in only two of the three areas: social life, sleep and will to live. In total you only need to retain 60% sanity across all attainable points. (Changes have been printed in bold).

Sufficient greetings
DS-TEAM
